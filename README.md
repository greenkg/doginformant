# Dog Informant

Dog Informant is a tool to help users choose an appropriate breed of dog.

This is a practice project for me to practice setting up a Rails app, adding search and filter functionality, combining a bit of javascript with Rails, styling with Bootstrap, and deploying to Heroku.

### Open items

* Add RSpec tests

* Host the static assets on AWS Cloudfront

* Continue to add to the database of dogs

* Add some sort of lazy load for pages rather than showing full database of dogs at once

* Continue to improve the front-end design for usability and aesthetics
